# portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!
Please note that much of my work and previous projects are private and thus not available. 

Nonetheless, please enjoy the projects that are listed here. They mainly include coursework.
In the main directory, there are the following directories:

neural_network_gpu/

mesh_graph/

uganda_patient_db/

While descriptions may be added in the future, for now, let the following brief descriptions of each folder suffice.

neural_network_gpu: For a course in Parallel Programming at Stanford University, we were assigned to train an MNIST digit recognizer from scratch and implement each CUDA kernel ourselves. Note that this is just the work I did (the helper functions). As is, the program will not run (there is no main method in any of the files). I worked on this in Spring 2022.

mesh_graph: For a course in Advanced Software Development, we spent the quarter implementing standard operations in a Graph data structure in C++ including add_node, remove_node, custom iterators and more. We used this to model mesh fabric and were able to visualize the physics of it wrapping around a ball or caught in the wind for example by implementing various functors throughout the quarter. I worked on this in Winter 2022. Note that various dependencies including thrust, mtl4, CME212 are not included so this too will not run as is.

uganda_patient_db: A proof of concept for a patient health record database. Outside from basic patient demographical data, the idea here was that this could store the abstract concept of a medical form and enable operations like the uploading of new forms and getting forms that satisfy a certain search criteria. I worked on this in Summer - Fall 2021.
